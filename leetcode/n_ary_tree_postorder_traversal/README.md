**Difficulty:** Easy
**Topics:** Stack, Tree, Depth-First Search
**Tags:** neetcode

**LeetCode:** [Problem 590](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-postorder-traversal/description/)

## Problem Description

Given the `root` of an n-ary tree, return _the postorder traversal of its nodes' values_.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal. Each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

## Examples

### Example 1:

![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/narytreeexample.png)

```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [5,6,3,2,4,1]
```

### Example 2:

![Example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/08/sample_4_964.png)

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: [2,6,14,11,7,3,12,8,4,13,9,10,5,1]
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 10^4
- The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000.

**Follow up:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
