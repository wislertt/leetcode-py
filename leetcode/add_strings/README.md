**LeetCode:** [Problem 415](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-strings/description/)


## Problem Description

Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: num1 = &quot;11&quot;, num2 = &quot;123&quot;
Output: &quot;134&quot;


Example 2:


Input: num1 = &quot;456&quot;, num2 = &quot;77&quot;
Output: &quot;533&quot;


Example 3:


Input: num1 = &quot;0&quot;, num2 = &quot;0&quot;
Output: &quot;0&quot;


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= num1.length, num2.length &lt;= 104
	num1 and num2 consist of only digits.
	num1 and num2 don&#39;t have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
