**LeetCode:** [Problem 34](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/description/)

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value.

If `target` is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: [-1,-1]
```

## Constraints

- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `nums` is a non-decreasing array.
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
