**LeetCode:** [Problem 1048](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-string-chain/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an array of `words` where each word consists of lowercase English letters.

`wordA` is a **predecessor** of `wordB` if and only if we can insert **exactly one** letter anywhere in `wordA` **without changing the order of the other characters** to make it equal to `wordB`.

- For example, `"abc"` is a **predecessor** of `"abac"`, while `"cba"` is not a **predecessor** of `"bcad"`.

A **word chain** is a sequence of words `[word1, word2, ..., wordk]` with `k >= 1`, where `word1` is a **predecessor** of `word2`, `word2` is a **predecessor** of `word3`, and so on. A single word is trivially a **word chain** with `k == 1`.

Return _the length of the **longest possible word chain** with words chosen from the given list of_ `words`.

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
Output: 4
Explanation: One of the longest word chains is ["a","ba","bda","bdca"].
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: words = ["xbc","pcxbcf","xb","cxbc","pcxbc"]
Output: 5
Explanation: All the words can be put in a word chain ["xb", "xbc", "cxbc", "pcxbc", "pcxbcf"].
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: words = ["abcd","dbqca"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The trivial word chain ["abcd"] is one of the longest word chains.
["abcd","dbqca"] is not a valid word chain because the ordering of the letters is changed.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 16`
- `words[i]` only consists of lowercase English letters.
