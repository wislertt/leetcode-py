**LeetCode:** [Problem 957](https://leetcode.com/problems/prison-cells-after-n-days/description/)

## Problem Description

There are `8` prison cells in a row and each cell is either occupied or vacant.

Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:

- If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
- Otherwise, it becomes vacant.

Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.

You are given an integer array `cells` where `cells[i] == 1` if the `ith` cell is occupied and `cells[i] == 0` if the `ith` cell is vacant, and you are given an integer `n`.

Return the state of the prison after `n` days (i.e., `n` such changes described above).

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], n = 7
Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:
Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], n = 1000000000
Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]
```

## Constraints

- cells.length == 8
- cells[i] is either 0 or 1.
- 1 <= n <= 10^9

**Follow up:** Could you solve it with `O(1)` extra space with respect to the number of days?
