## Problem Description

<p>The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in <strong>the bottom-right corner</strong> of a <code>dungeon</code>. The <code>dungeon</code> consists of <code>m x n</code> rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in <strong>the top-left room</strong> and must fight his way through <code>dungeon</code> to rescue the princess.</p>

<p>The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to <code>0</code> or below, he dies immediately.</p>

<p>Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight&#39;s health (represented by positive integers).</p>

<p>To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only <strong>rightward</strong> or <strong>downward</strong> in each step.</p>

<p>Return <em>the knight&#39;s minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.</p>

## Examples

### Example 1:

![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/13/dungeon-grid-1.jpg)

```
Input: dungeon = [[-2,-3,3],[-5,-10,1],[10,30,-5]]
Output: 7
Explanation: The initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path: RIGHT -> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: dungeon = [[0]]
Output: 1
```

## Constraints

- m == dungeon.length
- n == dungeon[i].length
- 1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 200
- -1000 &lt;= dungeon[i][j] &lt;= 1000
