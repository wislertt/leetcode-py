        Reorder a linked list in-place: L0→L1→...→Ln-1→Ln becomes L0→Ln→L1→Ln-1→L2→Ln-2→...

        Algorithm:
        1. Find the middle of the list using slow/fast pointers
        2. Reverse the second half of the list
        3. Merge the first half and reversed second half alternately

        This approach uses O(1) space and O(n) time.
