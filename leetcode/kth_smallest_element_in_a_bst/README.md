**LeetCode:** [Problem 230](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/description/)

## Problem Description

Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return the `k`th smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

## Examples

### Example 1:

![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/28/kthtree1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1
```

### Example 2:

![Example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/28/kthtree2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 10^4`

**Follow up:** If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?
