        Floyd's cycle detection - treat array as implicit linked list.

        Example: nums = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]

        Array as linked list:
        Index:  0  1  2  3  4
        Value: [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]
                ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓
        Points: 1  3  4  2  2

        Following pointers: 0→1→3→2→4→2→4→2... (cycle!)

        Visual cycle:
            0
            ↓
            1 ← start
            ↓
            3

            2 ←─┐ (duplicate = cycle entrance)
            ↓   │
            4 ──┘

        Phase 1: Find intersection using slow/fast pointers
        Phase 2: Find cycle entrance (duplicate) by resetting slow to start

        The duplicate creates the cycle entrance because multiple indices point to it.
