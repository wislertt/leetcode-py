**LeetCode:** [Problem 297](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/description/)

## Problem Description

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

## Examples

### Example 1:

![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/serdeser.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
