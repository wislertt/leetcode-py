        Topological Sort: Linear ordering of vertices in DAG where all edges go from left to right.

        Algorithm: Kahn's Algorithm (BFS approach)
        1. Build adjacency list and calculate in-degrees
        2. Start with nodes having 0 in-degree (no dependencies)
        3. Remove nodes and update in-degrees of neighbors
        4. If all nodes processed → valid ordering, else cycle exists
