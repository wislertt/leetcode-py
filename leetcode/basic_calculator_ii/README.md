**LeetCode:** [Problem 227](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii/description/)


## Problem Description

Given a string s which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value.&nbsp;

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-231, 231 - 1].

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().

&nbsp;
Example 1:
Input: s = "3+2*2"
Output: 7
Example 2:
Input: s = " 3/2 "
Output: 1
Example 3:
Input: s = " 3+5 / 2 "
Output: 5

&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 3 * 105
	s consists of integers and operators (&#39;+&#39;, &#39;-&#39;, &#39;*&#39;, &#39;/&#39;) separated by some number of spaces.
	s represents a valid expression.
	All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range [0, 231 - 1].
	The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

## Examples
