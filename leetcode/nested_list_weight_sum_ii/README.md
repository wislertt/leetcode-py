# Nested List Weight Sum II

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Topics:** Stack, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search
**Tags:** neetcode

**LeetCode:** [Problem 364](https://leetcode.com/problems/nested-list-weight-sum-ii/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a nested list of integers `nestedList`. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

The **depth** of an integer is the number of lists that it is inside of. For example, the nested list `[1,[2,2],[[3],2],1]` has each integer's value set to its **depth**. Let `maxDepth` be the **maximum depth** of any integer.

The **weight** of an integer is `maxDepth - (the depth of the integer) + 1`.

Return _the sum of each integer in_ `nestedList` _multiplied by its **weight**_.

## Examples

### Example 1:

![Example 1](https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/doocs/leetcode@main/solution/0300-0399/0364.Nested%20List%20Weight%20Sum%20II/images/nestedlistweightsumiiex1.png)

```
Input: nestedList = [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: 8
Explanation: Four 1's with a weight of 1, one 2 with a weight of 2.
1*1 + 1*1 + 2*2 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 8
```

### Example 2:

![Example 2](https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/doocs/leetcode@main/solution/0300-0399/0364.Nested%20List%20Weight%20Sum%20II/images/nestedlistweightsumiiex2.png)

```
Input: nestedList = [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: 17
Explanation: One 1 at depth 3, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 1.
1*3 + 4*2 + 6*1 = 17
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= nestedList.length <= 50`
- The values of the integers in the nested list is in the range `[-100, 100]`.
- The maximum **depth** of any integer is less than or equal to `50`.
- There are no empty lists.
