**LeetCode:** [Problem 436](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-right-interval/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an array of intervals, where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] and each starti is unique.

The right interval for an interval i is an interval j such that startj >= endi and startj is minimized. Note that i may equal j.

Return an array of right interval indices for each interval i. If no right interval exists for interval i, then put -1 at index i.

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2]]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: There is only one interval in the collection, so it outputs -1.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: intervals = [[3,4],[2,3],[1,2]]
Output: [-1,0,1]
Explanation: There is no right interval for [3,4].
The right interval for [2,3] is [3,4] since start0 = 3 is the smallest start that is >= end1 = 3.
The right interval for [1,2] is [2,3] since start1 = 2 is the smallest start that is >= end2 = 2.
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: [-1,2,-1]
Explanation: There is no right interval for [1,4] and [3,4].
The right interval for [2,3] is [3,4] since start2 = 3 is the smallest start that is >= end1 = 3.
```

## Constraints

1 <= intervals.length <= 2 * 10^4
intervals[i].length == 2
-10^6 <= starti <= endi <= 10^6
The start point of each interval is unique.
