        Find longest consecutive sequence using hash set.

        Example: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]

        Step 1: Create set {100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2}

        Step 2: For each number, check if it's sequence start (num-1 not in set):

        num=100: 99 not in set → START sequence
        100 → 101 not in set → length=1

        num=4: 3 in set → SKIP (not start)

        num=200: 199 not in set → START sequence
        200 → 201 not in set → length=1

        num=1: 0 not in set → START sequence
        1 → 2 in set → 2 → 3 in set → 3 → 4 in set → 4 → 5 not in set
        Sequence: [1,2,3,4] → length=4 ✓

        Result: max(1, 1, 4) = 4
