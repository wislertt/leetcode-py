# String Compression

**Topics:** Two Pointers, String

**LeetCode:** [Problem 443](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/description/)

## Problem Description

Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of **consecutive repeating characters** in `chars`:

- If the group's length is `1`, append the character to `s`.
- Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` **should not be returned separately**, but instead, be stored **in the input character array `chars`**. Note that group lengths that are `10` or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done **modifying the input array,** return _the new length of the array_.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

**Note:** The characters in the array beyond the returned length do not matter and should be ignored.

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output: 6
Explanation: The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".
After modifying the input array in-place, the first 6 characters of chars should be ["a","2","b","2","c","3"].
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: chars = ["a"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it is a single character.
After modifying the input array in-place, the first character of chars should be ["a"].
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
Output: 4
Explanation: The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to "ab12".
After modifying the input array in-place, the first 4 characters of chars should be ["a","b","1","2"].
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= chars.length <= 2000`
- `chars[i]` is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter, digit, or symbol.
