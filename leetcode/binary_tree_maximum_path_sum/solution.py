        Find the maximum path sum in a binary tree.

        A path is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes
        has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear once in the path.
        The path doesn't need to pass through the root.

        Uses DFS with post-order traversal to calculate:
        1. Maximum path sum that can be extended upward from current node
        2. Maximum path sum that includes current node as the highest point
