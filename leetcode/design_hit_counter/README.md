**LeetCode:** [Problem 362](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hit-counter/description/)

## Problem Description

Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past `5` minutes (i.e., the past `300` seconds).

Your system should accept a `timestamp` parameter (**in seconds** granularity), and you may assume that calls are being made to the system in chronological order (i.e., `timestamp` is monotonically increasing). Several hits may arrive roughly at the same time.

Implement the `HitCounter` class:

- `HitCounter()` Initializes the object of the hit counter system.
- `void hit(int timestamp)` Records a hit that happened at `timestamp` (**in seconds**). Several hits may happen at the same `timestamp`.
- `int getHits(int timestamp)` Returns the number of hits in the past 5 minutes from `timestamp` (i.e., the past `300` seconds).

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input
["HitCounter", "hit", "hit", "hit", "getHits", "hit", "getHits", "getHits"]
[[], [1], [2], [3], [4], [300], [300], [301]]
Output
[null, null, null, null, 3, null, 4, 3]

Explanation
HitCounter hitCounter = new HitCounter();
hitCounter.hit(1);       // hit at timestamp 1.
hitCounter.hit(2);       // hit at timestamp 2.
hitCounter.hit(3);       // hit at timestamp 3.
hitCounter.getHits(4);   // get hits at timestamp 4, return 3.
hitCounter.hit(300);     // hit at timestamp 300.
hitCounter.getHits(300); // get hits at timestamp 300, return 4.
hitCounter.getHits(301); // get hits at timestamp 301, return 3.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= timestamp <= 2 * 10^9`
- All the calls are being made to the system in chronological order (i.e., `timestamp` is monotonically increasing).
- At most `300` calls will be made to `hit` and `getHits`.

**Follow up:** What if the number of hits per second could be huge? Does your design scale?
