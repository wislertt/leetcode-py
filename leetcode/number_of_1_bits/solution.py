        Count the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of n.

        Uses the Brian Kernighan's algorithm:
        n & (n-1) removes the rightmost set bit from n.
        We keep doing this until n becomes 0, counting each iteration.

        This is more efficient than checking each bit individually
        because it only iterates for the number of set bits, not all bits.
