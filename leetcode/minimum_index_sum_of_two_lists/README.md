**LeetCode:** [Problem 599](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-index-sum-of-two-lists/description/)

## Problem Description

Given two arrays of strings `list1` and `list2`, find the **common strings with the least index sum**.

A **common string** is a string that appeared in both `list1` and `list2`.

A **common string with the least index sum** is a common string such that if it appeared at `list1[i]` and `list2[j]` then `i + j` should be the minimum value among all the other **common strings**.

Return _all the **common strings with the least index sum**_. Return the answer in **any order**.

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only common string is "Shogun".
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The common string with the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: list1 = ["happy","sad","good"], list2 = ["sad","happy","good"]
Output: ["sad","happy"]
Explanation: There are three common strings:
"happy" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
"sad" with index sum = (1 + 0) = 1.
"good" with index sum = (2 + 2) = 4.
The strings with the least index sum are "sad" and "happy".
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= list1.length, list2.length <= 1000
- 1 <= list1[i].length, list2[i].length <= 30
- list1[i] and list2[i] consist of spaces ' ' and English letters.
- All the strings of list1 are unique.
- All the strings of list2 are unique.
- There is at least a common string between list1 and list2.
