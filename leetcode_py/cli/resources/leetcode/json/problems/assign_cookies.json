  "readme_description": "Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.\n\nEach child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] &gt;= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. \nAnd even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.\nYou need to output 1.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. \nYou have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, \nYou need to output 2.\n\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 &lt;= g.length &lt;= 3 * 104\n\t0 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 3 * 104\n\t1 &lt;= g[i], s[j] &lt;= 231 - 1\n\n\n&nbsp;\nNote: This question is the same as  2410: Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers.",
